# Shared app domain

This folder holds all of the business logic which is shared by the app. Individual feature modules have their own domain to hold their specific business logic. It contains type definitions, constants, functions and zod validators.

Things exposed by the shared domain:

- All types for our cached db objects (monterey-payload-types)
